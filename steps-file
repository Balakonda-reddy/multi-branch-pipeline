What is a Multi-branch Pipeline? 

A multi-branch pipeline is a concept of automatically creating Jenkins pipelines based on Git branches.
It can automatically discover new branches in the SCM (Github) and automatically create a pipeline for that branch.

we can also ignore or deselect some branches, which u don't want to run in the total repo.


--> we create multibranch pipeline

--> in Branch Sources-- select git --if repo is private add credentials

--> in Discover branches -- select Filter by name (with wildcards)

--> In these option, we can select include and exclude branch option

--> In Build Configuration -- Script Path -- select script file name(jenkinsfile)

--> In jenkinsfile , we write pipeline script

--> Basic hello world script(Declarative pipeline script)

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}

--> Save and run (scan multiple branch pipeline)

--> Automatically the new jobs will create based on the branch names
